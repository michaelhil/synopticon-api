## Error Handling System Analysis

### ✅ Comprehensive Error Framework

**New Error Handling System** (`src/utils/error-handler.js`):

**Features:**
- 📊 **Severity Levels**: FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
- 🏷️ **Error Categories**: 8 specialized categories for better classification
- 🔄 **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery attempts for non-fatal errors
- 📈 **Error Statistics**: Comprehensive tracking and reporting
- ⚙️ **Configuration**: Flexible logging and behavior controls

**Error Categories:**
```javascript
INITIALIZATION: 'initialization',
WEBGL: 'webgl',
CAMERA: 'camera', 
PROCESSING: 'processing',
MEMORY: 'memory',
PERFORMANCE: 'performance',
NETWORK: 'network',
VALIDATION: 'validation'
```

### ✅ Standardized Error Patterns

**Before (Original Audit):**
```javascript
console.log('Error occurred'); // Inconsistent, no context
```

**After (Final Implementation):**
```javascript
errorHandler.handleError(
  'WebGL context creation failed',
  ErrorCategory.WEBGL,
  ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
  { contextType: 'webgl2', fallback: 'webgl1' }
);
```

**Error Reduction:**
- ✅ Console statements reduced from 30+ to standardized error handler calls

- ✅ Error history and statistics available for debugging

### ✅ Recovery Mechanisms

**Implemented Recovery Strategies:**
- **WebGL Recovery**: Context restoration attempts
- **Camera Recovery**: Permission re-initialization
- **Memory Recovery**: Garbage collection triggers
- **Retry Logic**: Maximum 3 attempts with backoff

**Test Results:**
- Recovery attempts properly limited to prevent infinite loops
- Failed recovery escalates to appropriate error levels
- Statistics tracking for recovery success rates
