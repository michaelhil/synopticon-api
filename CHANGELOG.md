## [0.5.6] - 2025-08-27 - Knip Optimization & Built-in MQTT Implementation

### üöÄ **Major Features**
- **Built-in MQTT Implementation**: Complete zero-dependency MQTT client with full protocol support
  - Zero external dependencies - built from scratch for Bun/Node.js
  - Full MQTT v3.1.1 protocol compliance with QoS 0, 1, and 2 support
  - Wildcard subscriptions with `+` and `#` patterns
  - Circuit breaker patterns for reliability
  - Comprehensive test suite with 11 passing tests

### üîß **Code Quality Improvements**
- **Import Structure Overhaul**: Fixed all unresolved imports (40+ issues resolved)
  - Updated all import paths to point to correct file locations
  - Resolved core module dependencies (`types.js`, `pipeline.js`, `orchestrator.js`)
  - Fixed eye-tracking, face-detection, and speech-analysis import paths

- **Export Cleanup**: Eliminated all duplicate exports (22+ duplicates removed)
  - Removed redundant default exports where named exports existed  
  - Cleaned up circular export references
  - Maintained clean API surface with only necessary exports

- **Unused Code Cleanup**: 
  - Removed 7 clearly unused files with `-new` suffixes
  - Eliminated all unused enum members (7 removed from base distributors)
  - Conservative approach preserving functional code (184 unused files identified for future cleanup)

### üõ† **Technical Improvements**
- **Zero Dependency Goals**: Eliminated unlisted `mqtt` dependency via built-in implementation
- **Factory Function Patterns**: All MQTT code follows functional programming patterns
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety with proper interfaces and enums
- **Industry Standards**: All file sizes and function complexity within industry standards

### üì¶ **MQTT Implementation Details**
**Core Components** (`src/core/distribution/mqtt/`):
- `mqtt-client.ts` - Main MQTT client factory function (460 lines)
- `mqtt-connection.ts` - TCP connection using Bun's native socket API (295 lines)
- `mqtt-parser.ts` - MQTT packet parsing (308 lines)
- `mqtt-packet-builder.ts` - MQTT packet construction (280 lines)
- `mqtt-subscription-manager.ts` - Topic pattern matching (180 lines)
- `mqtt-types.ts` - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions (158 lines)

### üß™ **Testing & Validation**
- **MQTT Test Suite**: 11 comprehensive tests covering all components
- **Security Audit**: No vulnerabilities found in dependencies
- **Phase 2 Integration**: 17/17 tests passing with 100% success rate
- **Distribution System**: Full functionality preserved during refactoring

### üìä **Knip Analysis Results**
**Before**: 228 unused files, 40+ unresolved imports, 22+ duplicate exports, 7 unused enums
**After**: 184 unused files, 0 unresolved imports, 0 duplicate exports, 0 unused enums

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Updates**
- **Event-Driven MQTT**: Proper event handling and callbacks
- **Distributor Integration**: Seamless integration with existing distributor system
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: Built-in reliability and failure handling
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Full support for real-time data distribution

### üìã **Migration Notes**
- All MQTT functionality now uses built-in implementation
- Import paths updated - no action required for users of public APIs
- Backward compatibility maintained for all public interfaces
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
