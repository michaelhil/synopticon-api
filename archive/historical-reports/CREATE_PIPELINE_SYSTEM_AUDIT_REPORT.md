## 6. Issues Identified

### 6.1 Pipeline Scoring System Issues ⚠️

**Issue**: Interface mismatch in pipeline scoring algorithm
- **Impact**: Medium - affects pipeline selection optimization in orchestrator
- **Affected Tests**: All pipeline scoring tests (performance-first, accuracy-first, battery-optimized)
- **Root Cause**: Health status interface mismatch between pipeline and scoring algorithm expectations

**Technical Details**:
- The `scorePipeline` function expects a different health status format than provided by pipelines
- Health status calculation returns NaN due to division by zero on newly created pipelines
- Scoring algorithm needs alignment with actual pipeline health status structure

**Recommended Resolution**:
```typescript
// Fix health status calculation in scoring algorithm
const healthStatus = pipeline.getHealthStatus();
const successRate = healthStatus.successRate || 1.0; // Default to 100% for new pipelines
score *= successRate;
```

### 6.2 Minor Cleanup Warning ⚠️

**Issue**: Test cleanup generates warning messages
- **Impact**: Low - cosmetic issue in test output
- **Cause**: Intentional error throwing in cleanup test scenario
- **Resolution**: Warning is expected behavior and doesn't affect functionality
