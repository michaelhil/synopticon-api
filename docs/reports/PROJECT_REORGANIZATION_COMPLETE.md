---

## 📋 Naming Conventions Established

### File Naming
- **TypeScript**: `kebab-case.ts`
- **Tests**: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`  
- **Configs**: `kebab-case.config.ts`
- **Documentation**: `GUIDE_*.md`, `REPORT_*.md`, `ROADMAP_*.md`

### Directory Naming
- **Features**: `kebab-case/` (e.g., `face-detection/`)
- **Grouping**: Singular forms (e.g., `config/` not `configs/`)
- **Test Types**: Clear type names (`unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`)

### Import Conventions
- **Relative imports** for same-level files
- **Feature imports** use consistent paths
- **Shared utilities** accessed via `shared/` path

---

## 🔧 Tools Created

### Organization Scripts (in `tools/scripts/`)
1. **`organize-docs.js`** - Automated documentation categorization
2. **`organize-tests.js`** - Test file organization by type
3. **`organize-examples.js`** - Example consolidation and categorization  
4. **`organize-configs.js`** - Configuration file centralization
5. **`reorganize-source.js`** - Feature-based source reorganization
6. **`update-imports.js`** - Import path updates after moves
7. **`fix-ts-imports.js`** - TypeScript-specific import fixes

### Generated README Files
- **Category READMEs** in each major directory explaining purpose
- **Usage instructions** for examples and tutorials
- **Guidelines** for maintaining organization

---

## 📈 Maintenance Rules Going Forward

### Root Directory Rules

2. **Only essential files** (package.json, README.md, LICENSE, etc.)
3. **No documentation** files scattered at root
4. **No test files** at root level
5. **No demo/example** files at root

### Organization Principles
1. **Feature cohesion** - Related code stays together
