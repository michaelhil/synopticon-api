### 2. Recording System Architecture

## üìπ Recording Implementation Options

### Option A: Internal Recording (Within Synopticon)

#### Implementation Approach
- WebM/MP4 container recording via MediaRecorder API
- Chunked recording (5-30 minute segments)
- Local filesystem storage with Bun.file() APIs
- Database indexing of recording metadata

#### Pros
- **Tight Integration:** Direct access to processed frames and analysis results
- **Synchronized Metadata:** Frame-perfect alignment of recordings with emotion/analysis data
- **Single System:** No external dependencies or APIs to manage
- **Low Latency:** Immediate recording start/stop without network overhead
- **Privacy:** All data remains within your infrastructure
- **Unified API:** Single endpoint for streaming, analysis, and recording

#### Cons
- **Storage Management:** Must implement retention policies, cleanup, disk monitoring
- **Scalability Concerns:** Heavy I/O load on Synopticon servers
- **Format Limitations:** Limited to browser-supported codecs (VP8/VP9, H.264)
- **Transcoding Needs:** May need post-processing for different playback scenarios
- **Backup Complexity:** Must handle redundancy and disaster recovery
- **Resource Competition:** Recording competes with real-time analysis for CPU/memory

#### Best For
- Research environments needing tight data correlation
- Small to medium deployments (< 20 cameras)
- Scenarios requiring immediate playback of recent events

---

### Option B: External Recording (Outside Synopticon)

#### Implementation Approaches

**B1: Dedicated Recording Service**
- Separate microservice consuming Synopticon's streams
- Technologies: FFmpeg, GStreamer, or cloud services (AWS Kinesis Video)

**B2: NVR/DVR Integration**
- Forward streams to existing Network Video Recorders
- Protocols: RTSP, RTMP, or HLS output from Synopticon

**B3: Cloud Storage Services**
- Direct integration with S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage
- Using pre-signed URLs for direct browser uploads

#### Pros
- **Separation of Concerns:** Synopticon focuses on real-time analysis
- **Scalability:** Recording infrastructure can scale independently
- **Professional Features:** Leverage specialized recording systems (redundancy, RAID, etc.)
- **Format Flexibility:** External systems can handle any codec/container
- **Cost Optimization:** Can use cheaper storage tiers for long-term retention
- **No Performance Impact:** Recording doesn't affect real-time analysis

#### Cons
- **Integration Complexity:** Must maintain sync between systems
- **Metadata Alignment:** Harder to correlate recordings with analysis results
- **Network Overhead:** Additional bandwidth for stream forwarding
- **Latency:** Delay between event and recording availability
- **Multiple Points of Failure:** More systems to monitor and maintain
- **API Management:** Need to coordinate between multiple services

#### Best For
- Large-scale deployments (> 50 cameras)
- Enterprise environments with existing recording infrastructure
- Long-term archival requirements (months/years of footage)

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

#### Implementation
- **Short-term Buffer** (last 1-24 hours) within Synopticon
- **Long-term Archive** via external system
- **Smart Tiering** based on importance/analysis results

#### Pros
- **Best of Both Worlds:** Immediate access + long-term scalability
- **Intelligent Storage:** Keep only important segments locally
- **Gradual Migration:** Can start internal, migrate to external as you scale
- **Flexible Retention:** Different policies for different data types

#### Cons
- **Most Complex:** Requires implementing both approaches
- **Synchronization Challenges:** Must manage data movement between tiers
- **Higher Initial Development Time:** More code to write and test
